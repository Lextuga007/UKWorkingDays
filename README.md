# UKWorkingDays

Code originally used for a [blog on NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/blog/count-of-working-days-function/) site which I used to work out the daily cost of my annual bus
ticket taking into account that I rarely used it on weekends or paid holidays.

The code was broken down step by step in the blog.
